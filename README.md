# Any file to QR
This is script that can convert any file to splited QR codes

## How it works
* Encode:
     1. Converts file to ascii85 or base64 text file
     2. Splits text file to many files with the maximum size of QR code (2953 bytes)
     3. Creates QR code from each file
* Decode
     1. Converts QR to splitted text files
     2. Connects files into one
     3. Decodes file using ascii85 or base64

## Requirement
* bash
* ascii85
* base64
* [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)
* [qrencode](https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode) (for encode QR)
* [zbar](https://github.com/mchehab/zbar) (also know as zbar-tools) (for decode QR)

## How to use
Script have two parametrs
* `create [file]` it will create QR codes into [file]_qr add `-b` before file to use base64
* `convert [qr codes dir]` it will convert file from QR codes in the given dir to `[file]_converted` **Warning! Script will try to convert all `.png` files from that dir so make sure it only has appropriate files**

Example of usage: `bash qr.sh create file.zip`, `bash qr.sh create -b file.zip`,`bash qr.sh convert file.zip_qr`

## But Why?
I really don't know. The process takes an unprofitable amount of memory and time:
1 Mib encode to 3,6Mib (base64: 3.8) in 450 (480) png files in about 5 seconds and decodes in about 1 minute but I have done it. You can now convert your favorite song into QR codes and hang it on the wall
